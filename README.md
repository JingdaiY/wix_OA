# Restful Web Application Project
This repository is for data web application services using Spring boot framework.
   * Nested queries are not supported in this version.
## Instructions:
1. mvn clean install
2. bring up RestDemoApplication in com.jy.restdemo
   * The RestDemoApplication is an entry which instantiates everything in the Framework.
3. More logs will be added. The related dependencies have been injected already and are good to use.
4. More unit tests need to be added and code coverage need to be improved. 
   * Only some tests have been added since the lack of time.
5. Integration tests need to be added.
6. Manually tests looks good to me. Postman collections are attached.
